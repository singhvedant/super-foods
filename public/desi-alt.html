                            <p class=" text-secondary text-justify">Quinoa is a superfood known for its high-fibre, high-protein seed, often mistaken for grain due to its texture when cooked. Quinoa has been a significant part of the diet in South American countries. There are a few alternatives
                                to quinoa that are readily available, including Daliya (Broken/bulgur wheat), which contains nutrients including iron, folate, copper, niacin, magnesium, etc. Dalia is rich in fibre and can prevent overeating, just like
                                oats. This cereal grain promotes your gut health and prevents the onset of constipation, a factor behind weight gain.</p>
                            <p class=" text-secondary text-justify">Kuttu, or buckwheat, is an alternative that has vitamins and is rich in fibre, along with magnesium, protein, and iron. It also lowers bad cholesterol in the body and is low in calories. </p>
                            <p class=" text-secondary text-justify">Amaranth is another local counterpart to quinoa, has been largely ignored. Also known as Rajgira or Ramdana—which loosely translates to the food of the Gods—it is considered one of the more essential foods of India, as per
                                Ayurveda. Calcium, zinc, iron and fibre—Amaranth scores higher than quinoa on these properties. Plus, it's so much more pocket friendly.</p>

                                it has been found that our locally produced oils, such as coconut, mustard, peanut or even sesame, have similar health benefits as olive oil. Coconut Oil, the base of most South Indian foods, has recently even been identified
                                as a superfood in the west. Likewise, Mustard Oil reduces inflammation, has antimicrobial benefits, and has a high smoke point. Good news for us; let’s get back to the basics.</p>
