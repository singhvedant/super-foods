                                at the same time. Curd is packed with the healthiest bacteria, which makes it a brilliant gut healer. Its probiotic nature improves the immunity system, and can potentially help your body fight everything from viral fevers
                                to the common colds and infections. Dahi is also good for every kind of gut issue, from indigestion to bloating. Add a little salt or sugar, and your body will feel more balanced and energised. Dahi is also a great stress-buster
                                and lowers anxiety levels. Which is exactly why Indian Mom’s keep insisting on consuming Dahi before exams. Dahi Chinni Nahi Khayenge toh goodluck Kese milenge?
